# How to update
As of Godot 3, there is no automated way to update plugins in a clean method.
As a workaround:

1. Close the Godot project.
2. Navigate to the `addons` folder of the project using the file explorer.
3. Delete the `addons/mongo-driver-godot` folder from your project directory
4. Follow the [installation](../installation) steps here to install the new version
